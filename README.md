# DocAssist — AI-Powered Patient Assistance System

DocAssist is an AI-powered patient assistance system designed to support symptom triage, case tracking, and follow-up medical queries using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
The project focuses on improving response relevance, contextual continuity, and clarity in medical interactions through structured prompt design and evaluation-driven iteration.

---

## Problem Statement

Patients often face challenges such as:
- Difficulty understanding symptoms and next steps
- Lack of continuity in follow-up medical queries
- Delayed or inconsistent responses to health-related questions

Traditional healthcare support systems are largely manual and lack intelligent, context-aware assistance.

---

## Solution Overview

DocAssist addresses these gaps by providing:
- Conversational AI for patient intake and follow-up queries
- Context-aware responses using structured prompt workflows
- Defined evaluation metrics to continuously improve response quality

---

## Key Features

- Symptom triage through conversational input
- Multi-turn, context-aware medical question answering
- Case continuity across patient interactions
- Response evaluation based on relevance and accuracy
- Iterative prompt refinement for quality improvement

---

## Technology Stack

- **AI / NLP:** Large Language Models, Prompt Engineering
- **Backend:** Python
- **Data Handling:** Structured inputs and evaluation metrics
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

---

## Performance Highlights

- Improved response relevance by approximately **30%**
- Reduced ambiguity in follow-up patient queries
- Clearly defined success metrics for iterative improvement

---

## System Workflow

1. Patient submits symptoms or a medical query  
2. System processes input using structured prompts  
3. LLM generates a context-aware response  
4. Output is evaluated using predefined metrics  
5. Prompts and logic are refined based on insights
